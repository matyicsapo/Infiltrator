Infiltrator is a top-down 2D single-player stealth game.
Developed in C++ utilizing SFML for cross-platform window handling, input, 2D graphics and audio.
It also is my thesis work for my additional year in high-school as a software developer.

That's it for now - this is just a 'test' README file.
